# Project-Vyom
Project Vyom is a personal aerospace engineering initiative focused on designing, building, and launching a solid-fueled rocket with active thrust vector control, custom avionics, and real-time flight data systems.
# ðŸš€ Project Vyom

**Project Vyom** is an ongoing personal aerospace engineering project aimed at developing a **solid rocket launch system** with **active thrust vector control (TVC)**, a **custom avionics suite**, and **modular flight systems**. The project combines propulsion engineering, embedded systems, control theory, and CAD design to create a guided high-performance sounding rocket.
