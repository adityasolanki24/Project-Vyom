# 🚀 Project Vyom

**Project Vyom** is an ongoing personal aerospace engineering project aimed at developing a **solid rocket launch system** with **active thrust vector control (TVC)**, a **custom avionics suite**, and **modular flight systems**. The project combines propulsion engineering, embedded systems, control theory, and CAD design to create a guided high-performance sounding rocket.

## 📌 Objectives

- ✅ Build a stable and scalable solid rocket motor
- ✅ Develop a precision thrust vector control system (servo or gimbal)
- ✅ Design a reliable, modular avionics platform (Teensy 4.1 + STM32)
- ✅ Implement real-time flight data logging and telemetry
- ✅ Validate flight performance via test launches

## 🧠 Key Subsystems

### 1. 📡 **Avionics**
- Teensy 4.1-based flight controller
- IMU (MPU9250 / BNO085), GPS (Ublox), barometer (BMP388)
- SD logging, LoRa telemetry (WIP)
- Modular sensor + firmware architecture

### 2. 🎮 **Thrust Vector Control (TVC)**
- STM32F405/411 for real-time servo control
- IMU-based attitude feedback and PID control loop
- High-speed UART/SPI interface with avionics
- Tunable control loop for dynamic compensation

### 3. 🔥 **Propulsion**
